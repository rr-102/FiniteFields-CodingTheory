# Reed-Solomon Codes
## Intro to Reed-Solomon

Reed-Solomon Codes are a type of error-correcting code that work by fitting data to a polynomial. Say we send n integers across a communication channel. We will call this x_n. We select n points, called evaluation points, which we will call e_n. Any n integers can be fit to a unique polynomial of degree n - 1, so we can determine a unique polynomial so that f(e_n) = x_n for all n. 

Why does this help us? We can choose an additional k evaluation points, and plug them into our polynomial to find an additional k integers on the curve. If we then append these k values onto our original signal, our receiver can remake the original polynomial as long as k or less detectable errors occur. This is because the original polynomial is unique for any n points. If we have at least n points, i.e. k or less errors, we can choose any n of the correct points to remake the correct polynomial, and reevaluate at values where errors occurred to retrieve the original message.

## Implementing Reed-Solomon using Lagrange Interpolation

Evaluating the polynomial and adding redundant points are relatively trivial. The more difficult part is finding the unique polynomial that fits the input. The method used to achieve this is Lagrange Interpolation which works as followed. For each of our evaluation points, create a polynomial such that it evaluates to 1 at this evaluation point, and 0 at every other. This can be achieved by multiplying out terms for zeros of every other evaluation point, and then multiplying by a constant term to scale this point to 1.

A mathematical notation for this is shown below.

Once we have a so-called "basis polynomial" for each evaluation point, we scale each basis polynomial by its associated value at the evaluation point. We can finally sum each scaled basis polynomial to get the fit. This works because each scaled basis will be the associated value at that point and 0 everywhere else. Therefore, when they are all summed, each basis polynomial only contributes to the value at the evaluation point.
