# Singleton Bound
In coding theory, the Singleton bound, named after Richard Collom Singleton, is a relatively crude upper bound on the size of an arbitrary block code with block length n, size m and minimum distance d.
Singleton Bound provides bounds for linear codes in a short length. In practice, we want to work with codes which are long with respect to the alphabet size. Thus we look for codes which are long, eï¬ƒcient, and correct many errors, but which perhaps are not optimal with respect to the Singleton Bound.
